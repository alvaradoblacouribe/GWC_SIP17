You wake up one morning and find that you aren't in your bed; you aren't even in your room.
You're in the middle of a lobby in an ancient abandoned hotel
A sign is hanging from the ivy: "You have one hour. Don't touch the walls, or you'll die."
There are two pathways, one is a pathway that leads to the door within darkness.
While the other path leads you to the ddoorway of darkness. Will you do the right thing? How will you know the difference? It is up to you to decide where you will go.
'''

left_hallway = '''
You go along the left hallway, you are burdened by a tremendous abstacle that has death written all over it. You must run as fast as you can to the end of the hallway
avoiding the fireballs that are being thrown at you. Use the spacebar to spray water from your bottle to protect yourself from fireballs.

light = '''
Congratulations my darling! You chose the pathway that leads to the light.
This was one of those desicions were you had to trust your faith and hope for the best.
The path of darkness would have given you a lost, wise choice! You resisted the temptation of evil. May the force be with you.")

'''

darkness = '''
You have entered the pathway to darkness and deception.
For you should have been careful about what you were thinking.
Eternal misery and chaos has infultrated your life. Better luck next time!
